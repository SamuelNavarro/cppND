# CppND-Garbage-Collector
The final project for this Memory Management course is to implement your own version of a smart pointer. You can think of this as implementing your own garbage collector, to use a concept from other programming languages. Building this project will help you understand both how to work with pointers and references, and also why smart pointers are so important to modern C++ programming. Complete the implementations and verify that your implementation does not have any memory leaks!

## Project TODO List:
- Complete `Pointer` constructor
- Complete `Pointer` `operator==`
- Complete `Pointer` destructor
- Complete `PtrDetails` class
